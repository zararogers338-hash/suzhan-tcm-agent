# OpenScience for Harbor

An installed-agent adapter for **Harbor 0.22.0**. Harbor owns the task image,
instruction, working directory, agent user, phase network policy, resource and
time limits, verifier, and scoring. This package installs and invokes OpenScience
and converts its event log (the root session and any delegated child sessions)
to ATIF. It does not replace the native benchmark runner or supply an evaluator.

The dependency is pinned to the version tested here. Moving Harbor `main`, older
0.13 task integrations, and future versions need their own conformance checks;
they are not covered by this package's compatibility claim.

## Check the adapter without running a benchmark

From the repository root:

```bash
uv run --project tooling/harbor --extra test python -m pytest tooling/harbor/tests
```

These tests use the real Harbor package, its installed-agent execution helpers,
error classification, and ATIF model/validator. A deterministic local executable
emits a recorded fixture; separate host and environment log directories exercise
the log-transfer boundary. They make no model calls and start no containers,
verifiers, or benchmark jobs. Passing them proves these adapter contracts, not a
benchmark score or every environment provider's behavior.

For a compiled Linux candidate, the [native conformance fixture](native-smoke/README.md)
runs one real Docker/Harbor task using a deterministic loopback provider and native
grader. It checks the actual binary, tool execution, working directory, reward,
and collected ATIF without a model service. This is a separate, explicit container
test; it is not part of the unit tests above or a scientific benchmark.

## Run a native task

This example is a real evaluation invocation and can spend money. Use the native
task and approved model, environment, limits, and retry settings for your study:

```bash
uv run --project tooling/harbor harbor run \
  --path /path/to/native-task \
  -a openscience_harbor.agent:OpenScienceAgent \
  -m provider/model \
  --ak binary=/absolute/path/to/compatible-linux-candidate \
  --ak binary_sha256=<expected-sha256>
```

The executable must support `run --workspace project`. Setup checks the public
CLI help and fails before task execution if that option is absent. The released
2.0.77 binary predates this option; **2.0.78 is the first compatible release**, so
`--ak version=2.0.78` (or a later release) can replace the local binary arguments.
Earlier releases are not compatible with this adapter's native workspace contract.

For a registered dataset, use Harbor's dataset arguments in place of `--path`.
Keep benchmark-specific task preparation, network restrictions, protected grading
credentials, and score aggregation in the native runner. Existing integrations
that pin another Harbor version should keep that pin until separately migrated.

`-m provider/model` uses Harbor's model connection handling to select the provider
key and configured base URL. Harbor resolves a key only for the provider slugs it
knows (its built-in model-connection registry); for any other provider the model
connection carries no key. To run such a provider, pass its API key through
`extra_env` (the environment variable that provider's OpenScience adapter reads,
for example `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) and, when needed, route it with an
`openscience_config` provider overlay (`provider.<slug>.options`). The adapter
does not collect grader credentials or copy the host environment wholesale.
Explicit `extra_env`, config overlays, task MCP servers, and skills are trusted
runner inputs: the adapter is not a policy sandbox for arbitrary runner
configuration. `--auto-approve` permits local task tools, so Harbor's environment
isolation remains essential.

### Options (`--ak key=value`)

| Option               | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`            | Exact compatible release (a leading `v` is accepted). Required unless `binary` is set. Must support `run --workspace project` and `--auto-approve`; setup checks the workspace option.                                                                               |
| `binary`             | Existing host path to a Linux OpenScience executable to upload. Captures its SHA-256 before setup; rejects changed files and upload mismatches. Useful for local builds or an offline agent install. System dependencies must already exist for fully offline setup. |
| `binary_sha256`      | Optional expected SHA-256 for `binary`; mismatch fails before setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `cwd`                | Optional absolute directory inside the task environment. Omit to preserve the task image's native working directory.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `variant`            | Provider-specific reasoning effort (`high`, `max`, `minimal`; model-dependent).                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `effort`             | Research effort, `normal` or `ultra`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `skills`             | Bundled skill catalog, `bundled` (default) or `none`. `none` sets `OPENSCIENCE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SKILLS` and is an ablation. Task-provided Harbor skills still copy in.                                                                                                |
| `agent`              | Primary agent; OpenScience defaults to `research`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `delegation`         | How freely the lead dispatches workers: `off`, `light`, `standard`, or `high` (`--delegation`). Omit to use the CLI's saved preference.                                                                                                                              |
| `worker_model`       | `provider/model` the workers run on (`--worker-model`). Defaults to the worker agent's or the lead's model.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `autonomy`           | How the lead treats decision points: `interactive`, `balanced`, or `autonomous` (`--autonomy`). `--auto-approve` defaults to `autonomous`.                                                                                                                           |
| `deadline`           | Wall-clock budget in whole seconds, shown to the agent as its time budget (`--deadline`). Harbor 0.22.0 does not hand the agent its trial timeout, so pass the task's agent timeout here explicitly; the adapter never infers one.                                   |
| `openscience_config` | JSON overlay deep-merged over the adapter's headless defaults. Can override those defaults; use only an approved configuration.                                                                                                                                      |

The four delegation options are recorded in `openscience-identity.json` and under
`extra.binary` of every generated trajectory, so a trajectory says which flags ran.

## Installation and run contract

For releases, the adapter fetches `install` from the requested OpenScience Git
tag, invokes it with the same version, and forces checksum verification on. The
installer selects the platform variant and verifies its release checksum. The
adapter then checks the installed version and records the executable's SHA-256.
A Git tag/release checksum is release selection and integrity evidence, not an
independent signature or an immutable source attestation.

For local binaries, upload and installation use the same version/digest checks.
If `version` is supplied with `binary`, the executable must report that version;
otherwise its reported version is recorded. `openscience-identity.json` captures
requested version, installed version, SHA-256, and installation source. Setup
ensures `curl`, `bash`, `coreutils`, and `git` through Harbor's dependency helper.

The run writes a separate headless config, copies declared task skills (including
dotfiles), registers task MCP servers and the selected model, and invokes:

```bash
openscience run --format json --auto-approve --workspace project --model <provider/model> [options] -- '<native instruction>'
```

Harbor's execution helper preserves the native agent user and applies `pipefail`
to the log pipeline. The instruction is shell-quoted without adding benchmark
hints. Explicit project workspace mode makes relative file tools and default bash
execution use the task directory. Starting the CLI there alone is insufficient:
ordinary new OpenScience sessions default to an isolated scratch workspace. The
project directory remains task-owned and must not be deleted by session cleanup.
The adapter adds no trajectory-import capability; Harbor's resume support
uses OpenScience's `--continue` in the existing environment and session data.

Defaults disable auto-update, LSP downloads, project config discovery, environment
bootstrap, and OpenScience's nested sandbox. The task container supplies isolation.
The existing `agent.title.disable` configuration is set to `true` to avoid model
calls for session and message UI labels. Research execution, compaction, skills,
and file-diff summaries are unchanged. Pass `--ak skills=none` to omit the
bundled skill catalog for an ablation lane. An approved `openscience_config` overlay
can re-enable titles; interactive OpenScience keeps its existing defaults.
Default permissions deny account-dependent and remote-compute tools
(`research_search`, `atlas`, `atlas_write`, `remote_compute`, `modal`,
`provider_compute`). `compute_job` is allowed: a local target runs inside the task
container without approval, while a remote target such as `{"kind": "modal"}`
still fails closed because its backend stays denied. The defaults also set
`experimental.continue_loop_on_deny`, so a denied call returns an error result to
the model and the run continues, matching `run --auto-approve` on a local server.
These defaults are not a general egress policy.

## Logs, failure, and accounting

The default environment artifact paths are:

| Path                                                  | Contents                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/logs/agent/openscience.txt`                         | Raw JSONL event stream with merged stderr.               |
| `/logs/agent/openscience-identity.json`               | Installed executable identity.                           |
| `/logs/agent/openscience/data`                        | OpenScience session state and copied task skills.        |
| `/logs/agent/openscience/config`                      | Headless configuration.                                  |
| `<Harbor trial agent logs>/trajectory.json`           | Validated ATIF v1.7 generated after log collection.      |
| `<Harbor trial agent logs>/trajectory-<session>.json` | One validated ATIF document per delegated child session. |

These paths follow Harbor's `environment_logs_dir` if customized. Task outputs
remain in the task workspace; they are not automatically relocated into logs.
The logs and session state can contain prompts, tool output, and research data.

A successful process is followed by an explicit remote log download **before**
`run()` returns. Success requires exactly one final `done` event with status
`completed`, exit code zero, a consistent root session, balanced model steps in
every session, and no session `error`. Missing, stale, or truncated logs cannot
imply success. Under `--auto-approve` an answered `question` event and a denied
tool call are ordinary events, not failures.
Nonzero process exits use Harbor's native classification; event-level failures
raise `NonZeroAgentExitCodeError`. The adapter does not retry: Harbor's job retry
policy governs retries. On process failure or timeout, Harbor's normal cleanup
and log synchronization retain available diagnostics.

ATIF keeps user text, agent text, reported reasoning, tool calls, and observations,
including tool errors and work from unfinished steps. It deduplicates repeated
part IDs for conversion, while duplicate events cannot pass the completion check.
Input totals include uncached input, cache reads, and cache creation; reasoning
tokens are recorded separately without adding them again to output tokens.
Explicit reported zero is retained; absent usage stays unknown. Interrupted or
inconsistent runs retain the observed usage under `final_metrics.extra`
(`observed_root_usage`, `child_usage`, and their sum `observed_usage`) and do
not claim complete totals. Harbor's `AgentContext` (the numbers leaderboards
sum) still receives that observed usage for such trials, so a timed-out or
errored attempt counts what it spent instead of reporting nothing; the ATIF
`usage_complete=false` flag marks it as a lower bound. Cost values are
OpenScience's **catalog estimates**, not verified provider charges; zero may
indicate unavailable model pricing.

`extra.usage_complete` refers only to recorded agent steps, as declared by
`usage_components` and `excluded_usage`. It does not establish whole-trial billing
completeness: unrecorded auxiliary model calls and external tool/compute charges
are outside this trace. Compare quality against independently reconciled total
trial cost and elapsed time, retaining failed attempts and any retries. Do not
use an ATIF catalog estimate alone to claim a cost-performance frontier.

### Delegated child sessions

Under `--auto-approve` the CLI keeps delegation on. Child sessions created by the
`task` tool stream into the same JSON output: each child event carries its own
`sessionID` plus a `parentID` naming the session that dispatched it, using the
same `step_start`/`step_finish`/`text`/`reasoning`/`tool_use` types. The final
`done` event lists every child under `children` with its agent, model, and summed
usage; `done.tokens`/`done.cost` remain the root session's own usage.

The converter writes the root session to `trajectory.json` and each child session
that recorded a step to `trajectory-<session>.json` beside it. The `task` call
that dispatched a child (matched through the call's `sessionId` metadata or the
`<task id="...">` envelope of its output) carries an ATIF
`subagent_trajectory_ref` with the child's `session_id` and relative
`trajectory_path`; a child's own `task` calls reference grandchildren the same
way. The child document's user step is the dispatching prompt, its steps carry
their own usage, and `extra` records `parent_session_id`, `dispatched_by`, and
the roll-up's `subagent` name.

Root `final_metrics.total_*` sum the root's recorded steps and every child's
usage, preferring the `done.children` roll-up and cross-checking it against the
child's recorded steps (`extra.child_metric_mismatches`, beside the root's
`terminal_metric_mismatches`). A child without streamed steps still counts
through the roll-up; a child without a roll-up entry counts through its steps.
`usage_complete` is true only when the run completed, every step in every
session carries usage, and no cross-check disagrees; a `task` call alone no
longer withholds totals. `extra.usage_scope` becomes `root_and_child_sessions`,
`extra.child_sessions` lists the children, and `extra.child_trajectories` maps
each written child file. Conversion/schema or artifact-write failures are
surfaced, not silently counted as valid trajectories.

The source contract is `backend/cli/src/cli/run-events.ts`. A passing adapter run
still needs the native verifier to determine whether the scientific task succeeded.
