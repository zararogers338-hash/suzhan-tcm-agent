# Security

## Threat model

OpenScience is an AI agent that runs locally on your machine. The agent can run shell commands, read and write files, and access the web.

### Execution sandbox

The permission system decides whether the agent may take an action. A permission prompt is not an isolation boundary by itself. New local installs default to **Approve for me**: the project is trusted and the execution sandbox is on. Routine work stays low-friction while commands are confined by the native sandbox when it is available.

Use **Research tools → Action approval** beneath the composer to switch to **Ask for approval** (keep containment and revoke project trust) or deliberately select **Full access** (trust the project and disable containment). In either contained mode, OpenScience wraps terminal and shell commands, Python/R kernels, and local compute jobs in macOS Seatbelt or Linux bubblewrap, confines reads and writes to the session workspace and explicitly granted paths, and denies network egress. Run `openscience sandbox test`; if it does not report **Containment verified**, do not rely on that backend. Windows has no sandbox backend, and the boundary is not a full VM. Use a container or VM for hostile code.

### Server mode

Server mode is opt-in. The server binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) only and enforces a Host and Origin allowlist to block DNS-rebinding and cross-origin requests. It is not built for remote exposure. If you tunnel or reverse-proxy it yourself, securing that exposure is your responsibility, and anything the server provides in that setup is not a vulnerability.

Self-hosted operators can set `OPENSCIENCE_AUTH_TOKEN` to require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on network requests as an additional deployment boundary. The health endpoint and browser CORS preflights remain open, and trusted in-process calls are unaffected. A reverse proxy must inject or forward the header on ordinary HTTP, streaming, and WebSocket requests. Leaving the variable unset preserves the local default.

### Local data and external services

Projects, settings, credentials, and session history are stored locally. When signed in, session trace sharing is enabled by default, subject to saved account preferences. Shared traces can include prompts, model responses and exposed reasoning, tool inputs and outputs, and provider-reported usage, including sessions using your own keys, subscriptions, or local models. Known credentials are redacted before traces are queued; this does not remove every kind of sensitive research content. Turn off **Customize → General → Data & privacy → Share session traces** to stop this device's uploads and clear its pending traces. Account opt-outs remain effective. See the [privacy policy](https://openscience.sh/privacy) for data handling and deletion controls.

Requests to model providers, scientific data sources, MCP servers, and other connectors use the services you configure or invoke. Managed Ace model requests use the OpenScience service; direct provider routes use the selected provider. The receiving service's security and data-handling policies apply. OpenScience may also contact GitHub for release and update metadata.

### Out of scope

| Category                    | Why                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server access when opted in | If you enable server mode, API access is expected behavior.          |
| Granted-root contents       | A command may read files inside roots explicitly granted to it.      |
| Windows sandboxing          | Windows has no execution-sandbox backend yet.                        |
| LLM provider data handling  | Data you send to a provider is governed by that provider's policies. |
| MCP server behavior         | External MCP servers you configure are outside the trust boundary.   |
| Malicious config files      | You control your own config; editing it is not an attack.            |

## Supported versions

Security fixes ship in the latest release on npm (`@synsci/openscience`). Please
upgrade to the newest version before reporting; earlier versions are not patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues through the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/synthetic-sciences/OpenScience/security/advisories/new) form.

You will get a response with the next steps. The team will keep you updated on progress toward a fix and may ask for more detail. If you do not hear back within six business days, email security@syntheticsciences.ai.
