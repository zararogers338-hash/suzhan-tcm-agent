**The open-source AI workbench for scientific research.**

Give it a goal. It reads the literature, writes and runs the code, runs the experiments, and writes up what it found, with every step on the record.

## What it is

OpenScience is a research agent with a workbench around it. You describe the task in plain language; it plans, gathers evidence, runs code and experiments, and hands back results you can check. It runs as a desktop app, a browser workspace, or a terminal command, on your machine, against your files.

It is built for the parts of research that are real work but not the idea: pulling and cleaning data, reproducing a claim, sweeping a parameter, drafting the methods section, checking a reference. You keep the idea and the judgment.

- **Every step is visible.** A turn reads as what happened: what it thought, what it searched, what it ran, what it wrote, then the answer. Nothing runs that you cannot see afterwards.
- **Real tools, real files.** Shell, Python and R kernels, notebooks, a file system with explicit read and write grants, remote compute when a laptop is not enough.
- **Scientific reach.** Hundreds of bundled skills across biology, chemistry, physics, ML and data engineering, plus connectors to databases such as ChEMBL, UniProt, PubMed and arXiv.
- **Delegation when it helps.** The lead agent can hand bounded work to workers, in parallel, and keeps the synthesis and the final say.
- **Your model, your terms.** Bring your own API keys, sign in to a supported provider, run a local model, or use Ace, the managed pay-as-you-go option.

## Install

**Desktop app.** [Download](https://openscience.sh/download) for macOS, Windows or Linux. It updates itself.

**Command line and browser workspace.**

```bash
npm install -g @synsci/openscience
openscience
```

Or run it without installing:

```bash
npx synsci
```

Or with the standalone installer on macOS and Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openscience.sh/install | bash
```

Then open **Customize → Models** and connect a provider, or from the terminal:

```bash
openscience keys add        # your own API key
openscience local add       # Ollama, LM Studio, or another local endpoint
```

The [installation guide](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/installation) covers platform details, updates and uninstalling.

## First task

Open a project folder and describe the work:

```bash
openscience ~/research/my-project
```

```text
Inspect data/samples.csv for missing values and inconsistent labels.
Keep the original data unchanged. Save a quality report and a plot
in results/, with the code needed to reproduce them.
```

Start with `/plan` when you want to agree on the method first. For a single turn from a script or a pipeline:

```bash
openscience run "Review the analysis plan in this project"
openscience run --continue "Suggest checks for the assumptions you identified"
```

Review sources, assumptions, code and outputs before relying on a scientific conclusion. The agent shows you what it did so that you can.

## What you can do

| Task                      | What happens                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Review literature**     | Search scientific sources, compare findings, save cited evidence.                                     |
| **Analyze data**          | Inspect inputs, write and run analysis code, produce figures and reports.                             |
| **Reproduce experiments** | Agree on a claim, prerequisites and budget, then compare measured results.                            |
| **Run compute**           | Local kernels for everyday work; Modal for GPUs and long jobs, each dispatch approved before it runs. |
| **Reuse procedures**      | Browse the bundled skills or add a workflow specific to your lab.                                     |
| **Extend it**             | MCP servers, custom agents and commands, plugins, or the TypeScript SDK.                              |

A skill describes a procedure; it does not mean every tool or service it references is installed. Check availability in **Customize** before a substantial task.

### NVIDIA BioNeMo

OpenScience ships ten bring-your-own-key adapters for NVIDIA BioNeMo NIM endpoints: Boltz-2, DiffDock, Evo 2, GenMol, MolMIM, MSA Search, OpenFold2, OpenFold3, ProteinMPNN and RFdiffusion. Each has a strict request schema, one approval per dispatch, and hashed artifacts written into the session; they are marked experimental and need your own NVIDIA API key under NVIDIA's service terms. The `protein-binder-design` skill is adapted from the [NVIDIA BioNeMo Agent Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA-BioNeMo/bionemo-agent-toolkit) (CC-BY-4.0 skills, Apache-2.0 code), pinned at commit `0e67a61`. See [Scientific tools](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/tool-catalog) and [Service credentials](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/service-credentials).

## How it works

```text
your request
  → Research agent plans, then works step by step
      → tools: shell, Python/R kernels, files, search, connectors, compute
      → workers for bounded parallel tasks (explore, execute)
  → answer, with the trace and the files it produced
```

- **Permissions.** Choose how much to ask: always, only for risky actions, or full access. Network commands ask once per destination host. Files outside the project are read or written only with an explicit grant.
- **Working folder.** A conversation works in the project's connected folder; caches and throwaway output stay in a per-session scratch space.
- **Publishing stays with you.** `git push`, releases and uploads run from the lead session with this machine's own GitHub and Hugging Face logins; no token is ever asked for in chat.

The [capability map](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/capabilities), [Explore tools](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/explore-tools) and the [skills directory](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/skill-library) list what is available and how to set it up.

## Model access

| Option            | Setup                                         | Cost                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Your provider** | An API key or a supported sign-in.            | Your provider's billing.                    |
| **Local model**   | Ollama, LM Studio or any compatible endpoint. | Your hardware.                              |
| **Ace**           | Sign in, choose a workspace, fund its wallet. | Provider cost plus a 5.5% fee, per request. |

An account is optional for your own keys and local models. Details are in [Models](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/models), [Local models](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/local-models) and [Pricing](https://openscience.sh/docs/#/openscience/pricing).

[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) explains how the pieces fit. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the development loops, the checks that gate a pull request, and how to add a skill, connector, tool or plugin. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the conventions the code follows.

## Releases

Stable releases are cut from `main` by the publish workflow after a full rehearsal at the same commit: packaged end-to-end tests, operating-system smokes and scientific capability canaries on every native platform. [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/synthetic-sciences/OpenScience/releases) carries the desktop installers, CLI archives and checksums; the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) records what changed for users.

The desktop app updates itself. For the CLI, run `openscience upgrade`, or `npm install -g @synsci/openscience@latest` for an npm installation.
