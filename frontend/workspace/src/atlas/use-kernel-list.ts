// Every poll parses a brand new response body, so feeding the resource
// straight into <For> would tear down and remount every kernel card on each
// 2.5s tick. Reconciling into a store keyed by the kernel's stable id keeps an
// unchanged kernel's object identity intact, so <For> leaves its card mounted;
// only a kernel whose fields actually changed gets patched in place. The list
// is genuinely dynamic (kernels appear, disappear, and get re-sorted by
// last_activity_at), so Index — which keys by position — is the wrong tool.
