/**
 * Molecular renderer bundle — 3D structures (Mol*) and 2D chemistry (RDKit.js).
 *
 * This folder is a self-contained feature bundle: each renderer is a standalone
 * Solid component that drives a framework-agnostic vanilla-JS library through a
 * ref (`onMount`/`createEffect`/`onCleanup`) with NO React dependency.
 *
 * `registrations` maps each supported `ArtifactKind` to its component. The
 * integration stage imports this array and registers each entry with the shared
 * renderer registry, e.g.:
 *
 *   import { registrations as molecular } from "./molecular"
 *   for (const r of molecular) register(r.kind, r.component)
 *
 * Neither this file nor the components touch `../registry`, `../index.ts`, or
 * `ScienceArtifact`.
