# OpenScience desktop

The desktop shell starts the bundled OpenScience runtime on a random loopback port and opens the existing workspace in a native window. It never exposes Node APIs to the workspace.

Release builds produce:

- macOS `.dmg` installers and `.zip` self-update payloads (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- Windows NSIS `.exe`
- Linux `.AppImage`

Set `OPENSCIENCE_DESKTOP_SIDECAR` to the native runtime before running `bun run dist`. Local builds are unsigned on Windows and ad-hoc signed on macOS. Production packaging sets `OPENSCIENCE_DESKTOP_SIGNED=true`.

macOS signing uses `CSC_LINK` and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`; notarization additionally uses `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. Stable production releases require those credentials and sign, notarize, and staple both the app bundle and its outer DMG installer.

Windows production packaging runs on Windows and uses Microsoft Artifact Signing with a validated Public Trust certificate profile. Set `WINDOWS_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `WINDOWS_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`, `WINDOWS_SIGNING_PROFILE`, and `WINDOWS_SIGNING_PUBLISHER` (the exact certificate common name). Authenticate with Azure CLI before packaging; GitHub Actions uses OIDC, without a client secret or exportable signing key. Electron Builder signs the copied sidecar, app executables, native libraries, NSIS uninstaller, and installer. The release workflow verifies Authenticode trust, publisher, and timestamps on the installer and bundled PE files before upload, and rechecks downloaded installers when resuming a release. While the Artifact Signing values are not configured in the repository, stable releases publish the Windows installer unsigned and the workflow says so in a warning. See [release setup](../../docs/notes/release-process.md#windows-signing-setup).

Only a notarized Developer ID build participates in desktop self-update. It downloads the exact architecture-specific ZIP from a published, non-prerelease GitHub release; verifies GitHub's SHA-256 digest, app identity, version, notarization, and publisher continuity; then uses the bundled signed sidecar for an atomic handoff. Stable publication keeps one packaged updater smoke on the release path; the full Apple Silicon and Intel lifecycle/rollback matrix remains available in deep CI. Ad-hoc-signed development builds remain useful for local packaging checks, but are never published as stable updater payloads and cannot self-update.
