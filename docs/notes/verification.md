# Local verification

Before pushing to `main` (or opening a PR), run the same gates CI enforces, so a
red build never reaches the default branch.

```bash
bun run format:check                     # Fast CI "Format"
bun run typecheck                        # all workspaces (tsgo), Fast CI "Typecheck"
bun run --cwd frontend/workspace build   # Fast CI "Build (web)"
bun run --cwd backend/cli script/generate-web-assets.ts
bun run --cwd frontend/docs build        # Deep CI only
bun run test:ui                          # Fast CI shared UI unit tests
bun run test:workspace                   # Fast CI workspace unit tests
bun run test:sdk                         # Fast CI SDK unit tests
bun run --cwd backend/cli test           # full CLI unit + integration suite
```

Fast CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request. It checks
formatting, monorepo types, release-entrypoint syntax, the workspace build,
all UI/workspace/SDK unit tests, and affected backend tests selected by
`tooling/repo/test-shards.ts`. The full backend suite and native platform,
docs/landing, and workflow checks run in Deep CI
(`.github/workflows/deep-ci.yml`, nightly and on manual dispatch). Cross-cutting
changes still need that full suite; a green affected-test selection is not
full-release evidence. Start backend tests through the `test` script: it passes
`--timeout 15000`, and bare `bun test` fails spuriously at Bun's 5 s default.

The landing site has its own lockfile and is not a root-workspace package:

```bash
(
  cd frontend/landing
  bun install --frozen-lockfile
  bunx tsc -b
  bun run build
)
```

Before a production release, also run the launcher and release-script smoke
checks from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. After the candidate lands, dispatch the
main-only **Deep release rehearsal** workflow (`.github/workflows/npm-test.yml`)
with its `run_packaged_e2e`, `run_os_smoke`, and `run_scientific_canary` inputs
enabled. The
workflow also installs the exact candidate and runs all five packaged
scientific capability lifecycles on Linux x64, Linux ARM64, and macOS ARM64;
each evidence record must match the immutable source SHA compiled into that
candidate. `test` dist-tag promotion depends on all fifteen capability/OS evidence jobs.
Production publishing also verifies the exact-source run and every required
job through the GitHub Actions API; disabled or skipped candidate gates fail
closed. When Modal is an advertised backend, also install the exact candidate
in an isolated release-operator root and run
`openscience debug capability-canary --all --target modal
--acknowledge-remote-cost`; retain the JSON report. The migration matrix, Windows Job
Object tests, macOS responsibility tests, Linux bubblewrap/OpenSSH integration,
and workflow lint run on their native CI platforms; the exact `main` commit
being released must be green there. The nightly/manual Playwright E2E workflow
is not a required push check, but run it for changes to packaged browser flows.

Notes:

- `.mdx` documentation pages are intentionally excluded from prettier (its MDX
  parser is deprecated and can mangle JSX-in-markdown). Keep them plain-markdown
  and let the docs build validate them.
- The model catalog is fixtured in tests, so the suite is deterministic and runs
  offline; a nightly job checks the live catalog for delistings separately.
- Synthetic Sciences account routes degrade gracefully when signed out or
  offline; exercise both states when touching them.

## Release-specific evidence boundaries

- Native DeepSeek direct-BYOK routing and strict tool-schema normalization have
  deterministic contract coverage. A live official-API canary has not yet been
  recorded, so release claims must not describe that route as live-verified.
- The scientific capability registry contains 54 truthful inventory entries.
  Five experimental Python capabilities have full governed local/Modal
  lifecycles and exact runtime locks; ten experimental BioNeMo capabilities
  have strict BYOK NVIDIA NIM adapters; two entries are blocked. Source-tree
  local and Modal preparation canaries do not make a released package verified:
  require matching release-artifact evidence before changing maturity or making
  a live-verified claim. No live BioNeMo provider canary is implied by offline
  tests.
- Modal concurrency is an admission limit. A start beyond capacity should fail
  visibly; autonomous waiting-queue behavior is deferred and must not appear in
  product or release copy.
- Stable releases require signed, notarized macOS DMGs and updater ZIPs; there
  is no unsigned stable macOS channel. Both architectures must retain immutable
  GitHub digests and pass their native previous-stable upgrade, packaged
  main/sidecar health, cleanup, and injected safe-rollback canaries before the
  draft is made public. Until all six Windows Artifact Signing configuration
  values are present, the Windows installer is unsigned with a workflow warning
  naming the missing values and an explicit release note. A configured signing
  or signature-verification failure must block publication.
- Organization-scoped workspaces shipped in PR #413. Tests must preserve the
  selected workspace, membership permissions, and purchased-Wallet boundaries;
  a passing personal-account test does not establish organization billing.
