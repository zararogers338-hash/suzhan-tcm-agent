# Adding a bundled skill

A bundled skill is a `SKILL.md` instruction bundle under `backend/cli/skills/`
that ships with every release. This guide covers contributing one to the
default library; [skills.md](skills.md) explains how skills are discovered and
resolved at runtime, and `openscience skill new` creates a personal skill
outside the repo.

See the [skill runtime design](skill-runtime-design.md) for bounded discovery,
source precedence, and permission checks when a skill is loaded.

## Where it goes

```
backend/cli/skills/<category>/<name>/
  SKILL.md          # required: frontmatter + instructions
  scripts/          # optional helper scripts the instructions reference
  references/       # optional background documents
  assets/, templates/
```

- `core` is the curated set the Research agent always indexes; see
  `docs/notes/skills.md` before adding to it, and add a `summary`.
- `<category>` is one of the existing directories (`biology`, `chemistry`,
  `cloud-compute`, `coding`, `data-engineering`, `databases`,
  `document-parsing`, `llm-tools`, `ml-inference`, `ml-training`, `other`,
  `physics`, `quantum`, `research`, `scholar-evaluation`, `visualization`,
  `writing`). Add a directory only with maintainer agreement.
- `<name>` is lowercase with hyphens and must equal the frontmatter `name`.
  Names are global across every skill source, so pick something specific
  (`scanpy`, not `single-cell`).
- Never reuse a retired product name. `backend/cli/src/skill/retired.ts` lists
  them (the `atlas-*` family) and `bundle-format.ts` refuses to build a release
  archive that contains one.

## Frontmatter contract

The parser is `Skill.Info` in `backend/cli/src/skill/skill.ts`; the validate
command and `test/skill/bundled-skills.test.ts` check the same fields.

The body is plain Markdown: an overview, when to use it, the workflow, and the
pitfalls. Reference helper scripts by path relative to the skill directory.
`backend/cli/skills/` is excluded from Prettier, so format the file by hand and
keep lines readable.

### Attribution

A skill taken or adapted from another collection keeps its author. Set `author`
and `metadata.skill-author` to the upstream author, record the source under
`metadata.upstream`, `upstream-url`, `upstream-path`, `upstream-license` and
`upstream-relationship` (`derived`, `adapted and rewritten`, `references and
scripts derived`, or `vendored`), and add `adapted-by: Synthetic Sciences`. Add
the skill to `backend/cli/skills/ATTRIBUTION.md`, and to `NOTICE` when it is
the first skill from a new source or arrives under a new license. Keep any
`LICENSE` file that came with it. A skill written here from scratch needs none
of this; `author: Synthetic Sciences` is the default.

## Validate and test

`bun dev` runs with `backend/cli` as its working directory, so pass paths
relative to that directory (or absolute paths):

```bash
bun dev skill validate skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md            # frontmatter + safety review
bun dev skill validate skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md --strict   # also fail on warnings
bun dev skill list --all                                            # confirm it is discovered
```

The safety review rejects prompt-injection patterns and flags suspicious
instructions; fix rejections before opening a pull request.

```bash
cd backend/cli
bun test --timeout 15000 ./test/skill/bundled-skills.test.ts   # every bundled SKILL.md parses
bun test --timeout 15000 ./test/skill                          # the rest of the skill suite
```

`bundled-skills.test.ts` pins the number of bundled skills;
bump it in the same change when you add or remove one. Do not add counts to
README.md or the docs site; they drift with every skill change.

## Try it

Run the workspace in this checkout (`bun dev "$PWD"`) and ask the agent to use the
skill by name, or load it directly with the skill tool. Dev mode reads
`backend/cli/skills/` from disk, so edits show up on the next session without a
rebuild. Release builds embed the tree through
`backend/cli/script/generate-skill-bundle.ts`; nothing else is needed.

## Pull request

- Title `feat(skills): add <name>` or `fix(skills): <what broke>`. A broken
  bundled skill (bad script, changed upstream API) does not need an issue first.
- Say which commands or notebooks you ran to confirm the instructions work.
- Add a line under **Unreleased** in `CHANGELOG.md` for a new skill.
