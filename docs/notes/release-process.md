# Release process

OpenScience ships as native binaries and an npm package
(`@synsci/openscience`). Releases are cut from `main`, never from a feature
branch. This note is the maintainer procedure; contributors only need the
"Releases and versioning" section of [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md):
never bump a version in a pull request, and add user-visible changes to the
**Unreleased** section of `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Cutting a release

1. Make sure the exact `main` commit you will release is green across the full
   CI workflow: Typecheck, Format, the Linux test suite, web/docs and landing
   builds, migration and runtime ownership checks on their platform matrices,
   launcher/release-script smoke tests, and workflow linting.
   Browser tests must pass on their first attempt. CI keeps one retry for
   diagnosis, but a passing retry still fails the gate; the original failed
   attempt's trace and screenshot remain available in the workflow artifacts.
2. Trigger the `Deep release rehearsal` (`npm-test.yml`) from that exact
   `main` commit with packaged E2E and OS smokes enabled. It builds and packs
   the fifteen-package candidate once, then every gate job installs the exact
   candidate version through a localhost registry that serves those tarballs
   (`tooling/repo/candidate-registry.ts`): the real npm resolver, platform
   selection and integrity checks run, but nothing is uploaded to
   registry.npmjs.org and nothing waits for it. Publication is blocked until
   the candidate also installs and completes all five packaged scientific
   capability smoke lifecycles on Linux x64, Linux ARM64, and macOS ARM64.
   Each canary must report a ready exact-pack doctor state, semantic artifact
   validation, and evidence bound to the candidate's source SHA embedded in
   the compiled binary. A workflow environment variable is only a cross-check
   and must not be accepted as the source of release provenance. The
   rehearsal takes about fifteen minutes; the registry is touched only by the
   `npm-preflight` job, which proves the credentials and that the version is
   free.

   ```bash
   gh workflow run npm-test.yml --ref main \
     -f run_packaged_e2e=true \
     -f run_os_smoke=true \
     -f run_scientific_canary=true
   ```

   Before production, install that exact candidate in an isolated release
   operator root and run its bounded Modal smokes with the configured Modal
   account. This is the explicit paid-compute acknowledgement; archive the JSON
   report with the release evidence and do not substitute a source-tree run.

   ```bash
   openscience debug capability-canary --all --target modal \
     --acknowledge-remote-cost --timeout 900
   ```

3. After every candidate job succeeds, trigger the signed production `publish`
   workflow with a bump level:

   ```bash
   gh workflow run publish.yml --ref main -f bump=patch
   ```

   Production preflight independently queries the GitHub Actions API for that
   exact artifact-source SHA. It accepts only a completed rehearsal run whose
   `npm-preflight`, packaged E2E, four native OS smokes, musl smoke, and all
   fifteen scientific capability canaries (five capabilities on each of the
   three native runners, one job per pair) succeeded. A run with either
   optional gate disabled, or with any required job skipped, cannot publish.
   The publish workflow is the only place the release is staged on npm; it
   waits for the registry to make every package visible (up to forty minutes
   per pass) before promoting `latest`.
   Exact-version resumes remain bound to the immutable source marker in the
   existing draft release; the workflow rejects any mismatch before building.

   Stable publication requires macOS Developer ID signing and notarization.
   Windows Artifact Signing runs when all six signing configuration values are
   present. Until setup is complete, the Windows installer is published unsigned
   with a workflow warning naming the missing values and a release disclosure.
   The draft-note step adds or removes that disclosure from the actual signing
   decision and preserves the source marker and authored release notes.
   Once configured, signing or signature-verification failures block publication.
   Ad-hoc-signed macOS development packages must never be attached to a stable
   update release.

   The next version is derived from the current npm `latest`, so there is no
   manual version editing in `package.json` and no risk of a tag collision.

4. The workflow then, in order: computes the version and opens a draft GitHub
   release → builds the platform binaries, signed Windows desktop installer,
   and signed/notarized macOS desktop installers → verifies Windows Authenticode
   signatures and the immutable ZIP and DMG on native Apple Silicon and
   Intel runners → upgrades a previous immutable signed stable app through the
   real helper/sidecar handoff, proves packaged main and runtime health and
   cleanup, and injects a safe health failure to prove rollback → uploads and
   verifies the checksum manifests → verifies the Linux x64 and ARM64 npm
   wrappers on native runners → publishes the CLI, SDK, plugin, and launcher
   packages to npm with provenance → makes the release public only after every
   updater lifecycle and publication gate succeeds → records an npm deployment. If no older digest-bound signed stable
   updater ZIP exists for an architecture, the release fails closed.

   The publish job commits the generated package-version changes. It pushes that
   commit to `main` when the workflow identity may bypass branch protection;
   otherwise it opens a `release/vX.Y.Z` pull request. A green publish can
   therefore still require that small release PR to be merged.

## Conventions

- The repo bundles features into **patch** bumps unless a change is breaking;
  a feature release does not automatically imply a minor bump here.
- `bump` accepts `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. A reviewed resume or retry may
  provide an exact stable `version`; new releases normally derive the next
  stable version from npm `latest`. An exact-version resume must run from its
  immutable `v<version>` tag and may bind pre-existing desktop assets only with
  a reviewed digest manifest.
- The tag (`vX.Y.Z`) points at the exact tree that was published.

## Verifying a release

```bash
npm view @synsci/openscience version
npm view @synsci/sdk version
npm view @synsci/plugin version
npm view synsci version
gh release view vX.Y.Z --json isDraft,tagName,targetCommitish,assets
```

Confirm that the CLI, SDK, plugin, and launcher packages plus all 11 native npm
packages report the new version and expected dist-tags. Confirm that the GitHub
release is not a draft, the tag targets the release commit, and the assets include the
11 platform archives, `checksums.txt`, `desktop-checksums.txt`, two macOS DMGs,
two architecture-specific macOS updater ZIPs, one Windows EXE, and two Linux
AppImages: 20 release assets in total. Inspect the publish run for launcher
warnings. Windows signing, macOS signing, notarization, immutable
asset verification, and both native updater lifecycles are fatal gates. Publishing the `synsci` launcher is required in
both test and production releases; a launcher failure leaves the GitHub release
as a draft. Never bypass the updater lifecycle job or replace a stable macOS
asset with an ad-hoc-signed build.

See [verification.md](verification.md) for the local gates to run before you
push to `main`.

## Windows signing setup

Complete [Microsoft Artifact Signing identity validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/artifact-signing/quickstart)
for the legal company, then create a **Public Trust** certificate profile.
Pending organization validation is not a usable signing certificate.

Create a dedicated Entra application and a GitHub Actions federated credential:

- Issuer: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- Subject: `repo:synthetic-sciences/openscience:ref:refs/heads/main`
- Audience: `api://AzureADTokenExchange`

Assign **Artifact Signing Certificate Profile Signer** to that application's
service principal, scoped to the certificate profile. No subscription Owner,
Contributor, or client secret is needed. The publish job logs in using OIDC and
the signing module obtains its token through Azure CLI. Release repair resumes
must also run from `main` to match the federated credential.

Configure these repository secrets:

| Secret                      | Value                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_CLIENT_ID` | Entra application's client ID |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_TENANT_ID` | Entra tenant ID               |

Configure these repository variables:

| Variable                    | Value                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`  | Account's regional endpoint, such as `https://eus.codesigning.azure.net/` |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`   | Artifact Signing account name                                             |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_PROFILE`   | Validated Public Trust certificate profile name                           |
| `WINDOWS_SIGNING_PUBLISHER` | Exact certificate common name, such as `InkVell Inc.`                     |

The former `WINDOWS_CSC_LINK` and `WINDOWS_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` secrets are no longer
used. Until all six values above exist, the publish preflight records a warning
naming the missing ones and the Windows installer is published unsigned, as it
was before Artifact Signing was introduced. Once they are all set, the workflow requires a trusted, timestamped signature
from the configured publisher on the installer, app, sidecar, and bundled native
libraries. A resumed
installer must match its GitHub SHA-256 digest and pass signature verification
again. This applies to the desktop installer; standalone Windows CLI archives
are outside this signing path.

Signing identifies the publisher, but new downloads can still display
[SmartScreen reputation warnings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/smartscreen-reputation).
Do not claim that signing immediately removes every Windows warning.

## Isolated npm test installs

The rehearsal workflow checks the registry credentials and therefore runs only
from the protected `main` branch. Validate a candidate branch with the local
pack/build and browser gates first; after it lands on `main`, dispatch the
rehearsal and require packaged E2E, operating-system smoke, and every native
scientific-capability canary job (one per capability and runner) to pass before
starting production publish. To reproduce a gate job locally, pack the
candidate and serve it the same way:

```bash
bun tooling/repo/candidate-registry.ts serve --dir .release/npm-test/<version> --port 4873
NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=http://127.0.0.1:4873/ npm install --global --prefix /tmp/candidate "@synsci/openscience@<version>"
```

Every npm test build must use separate binary, config, data, cache, and state
roots. Use the exact prerelease version being validated; do not rely on a
moving dist-tag after installation.

```bash
export OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT="/tmp/openscience-npm-2.0.2-test.N"
mkdir -p "$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/home"
: >"$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/npmrc"

export HOME="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/home"
export OPENSCIENCE_TEST_HOME="$HOME"
export OPENSCIENCE_CONFIG_DIR="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/config"
export OPENSCIENCE_DATA_DIR="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/data"
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/xdg-config"
export XDG_DATA_HOME="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/xdg-data"
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/cache"
export XDG_STATE_HOME="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/state"
export NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/npm"
export NPM_CONFIG_CACHE="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/npm-cache"
export NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/npmrc"

npm install -g @synsci/openscience@2.0.2-test.N synsci@2.0.2-test.N
export PATH="$OPENSCIENCE_TEST_ROOT/npm/bin:$PATH"

openscience --version
synsci --version
openscience doctor
```

`OPENSCIENCE_CONFIG_DIR` is the authoritative OpenScience config directory,
and `OPENSCIENCE_DATA_DIR` is the authoritative application data directory.
When the config override is set, OpenScience does not also discover
`~/.openscience` or the normal XDG config directory. Config discovery is
dependency-passive: it does not create a package manifest, lockfile,
`node_modules`, or run dependency installation. A plugin named explicitly by
trusted config may still be installed when that plugin is actually loaded.

Removing the npm prefix does not remove the config or data roots. Retain them
for upgrade/uninstall validation, or remove the whole test root only after the
test record no longer needs it.
