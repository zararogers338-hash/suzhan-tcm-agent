/**
 * Shared persistence for small JSON-object credential stores (auth.json,
 * mcp-auth.json). Every write goes through a temp file in the same directory
 * followed by a rename, so a crash or concurrent reader never observes a torn
 * file, and every read-modify-write cycle is serialized behind the in-process
 * Lock keyed by file path plus an on-disk lease shared by independent CLI
 * processes.
 *
 * A file that exists but cannot be parsed is fatal on the write path:
 * proceeding with `{}` would rewrite the store containing only the entry
 * being saved and silently destroy every other credential. The corrupt file
 * is backed up alongside and the write throws. The read path degrades to
 * `{}` so the CLI still boots.
