/**
 * Classifies credential revision reasons into the runtimes they may reach.
 *
 * Every published revision used to trigger one response: kill every
 * credential-bearing child, stop every command, and dispose every project
 * instance, which also aborted the model request of every active turn. That
 * was wrong for the expiry of the synchronized workspace overlay. The synced
 * provider and service keys are a short-lived, revocable overlay that is
 * separate from Ace's managed-model access and from the keys this device owns,
 * so letting them lapse invalidates only the children that inherited the
 * overlay. A turn running on managed or local credentials never used the
 * expired grant; disposing its runtime surfaced as "Bash failed" with empty
 * arguments for a tool call that had not even started.
 *
 * The security model is unchanged: an expired grant is cleared before the
 * revision is published, so no new request can use it, and every child stamped
 * with the overlay is still killed. Only the blast radius is narrowed.
