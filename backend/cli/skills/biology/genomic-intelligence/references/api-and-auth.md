# REST API & Authentication

Base URL: `https://api.genomicintelligence.ai` (override with `GI_BASE_URL` for
staging). Live contract: <https://api.genomicintelligence.ai/v1/openapi.json>.

## Authentication

Every `/v1/*` REST call needs a partner bearer key, sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Public routes needing no key: `/health`, `/docs`,
`/redoc`, `/v1/openapi.json`.

```bash
export GI_API_KEY="gi_yourkeyhere"
```

Keys begin with `gi_`. Request one at contact@genomicintelligence.ai. Read the
key from the environment (or a `.env` via `python-dotenv`); never hardcode or
commit it.

> The hosted **MCP** server (`mcp.genomicintelligence.ai/mcp`) is different: it
> runs **keyless** against a rate- and concurrency-limited public demo tier, with
> the key optional for higher limits. Only the **REST** path strictly requires a
> key. See `mcp.md`.

## Endpoints

Eleven operations are published. The six predict paths are **literal, one per
task**; the published document has no templated `/v1/tasks/{task}/predict`
operation.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/v1/tasks/promoter/predict` | `PromoterPredictRequest` |
| POST | `/v1/tasks/splice/predict` | `SplicePredictRequest` |
| POST | `/v1/tasks/enhancer/predict` | `EnhancerPredictRequest` |
| POST | `/v1/tasks/chromatin/predict` | `ChromatinPredictRequest` |
| POST | `/v1/tasks/annotation/predict` | `AnnotationPredictRequest` |
| POST | `/v1/tasks/expression/predict` | `ExpressionPredictRequest` (also requires `options`) |
| POST | `/v1/workflows/find-genes-and-predict-expression` | Composite: find genes, predict each one's expression |
| GET | `/v1/tasks/jobs` | List async jobs |
| GET | `/v1/tasks/jobs/{job_id}` | Poll an async job (202 running → 200 terminal) |
| GET | `/v1/tasks/{task}/models` | List available model IDs for a task |
| GET | `/health` | Public liveness |

There is no usable templated route to fall back on: the six literal paths are
matched first, and any other task segment is `404 not_found`
(`"Unknown task: bogus"`), never a `422`.

`Prefer: respond-async` is a declared header parameter on all six predict
operations and on the composite — it is not an annotation-only extra. Omit it
for a synchronous `200`; send it for a `202` carrying
`{data: {job_id, status: "accepted", links}, meta}`, with the id also in
`Content-Location` and `X-Job-Id`, then poll `GET /v1/tasks/jobs/{job_id}`.
Async is JSON-only: combining it with a text `format` is a `400`.

## Request / response

Request body: `{sequence, sequence_name?, model?, options?}` — but there is no
longer a shared `PredictRequest`. Each task has its own request model with its own
`minLength` (promoter 300, splice 100, enhancer 50, chromatin 200, annotation
1,000, expression 9,198, composite 1,000; `maxLength` 500,000 for all), and every
one is `additionalProperties: false`. `options` is likewise typed and closed per
task, so an unknown key is `422 validation_failed` with `type: "extra_forbidden"`
at `loc ["body","options","<key>"]`.

**`expression` differs further**: its body is
`{sequence, options, tss_index?, sequence_name?, model?}`, `options` is required
(`ExpressionOptions.required = ["description"]`, the only key it accepts), and
`tss_index` is required unless `sequence` is exactly 9,198 bp. See
`tasks.md#expression`.

Hand-built requests are unaffected. A client **generated** from an older OpenAPI
document must be regenerated against the current one: the shared `PredictRequest`
model such clients were built from is not in the published document.

Success is a `{data, meta}` envelope; `data` is task-specific (see `tasks.md`),
`meta` carries model + request info. **Exception:** `GET /v1/tasks/{task}/models`
is *not* enveloped — it returns a flat
`{task, default_model, models: [{id, name, description, is_default, bio_spec}]}`.

Errors use an `{error}` envelope carrying `code`, `message`, `request_id` and an
optional `details`; the most common is `422 validation_failed` (wrong sequence
length — under the floor *or* over 500,000 bp; over-length is not a `413`).

## `bio_spec` (from `GET /v1/tasks/{task}/models`)

- `request_max_bp` — the enforced ceiling: 500,000 for every model.
- `context_window_bp` — the model's own sliding window; `null` for annotation and
  expression. The promoter default reports 2,000 (the 300 bp promoter models
  report 300), splice 15,000, enhancer 249, chromatin 1,000. Compare your sequence
  length against this to know whether the model scored real sequence or padding.
- `trained_window_bp` — fixed receptive field; 9,198 for the expression model,
  `null` for sliding-window models.
- The legacy `max_seq_length_bp` is not part of `bio_spec` and is absent from the
  response. It was ambiguous — it read 9,198 for the expression model, the trained
  window rather than a request cap, so gating on it wrongly rejected the
  9,198–500,000 bp range expression accepts. Use `request_max_bp`.

There is no `strand_sensitive` flag. The splice model is strand-specific in
practice — feed transcript orientation.

## Partner tiers

Keys are scoped to a tier with concurrency and per-minute caps. A `429` means a
cap was hit — back off and retry, or ask GI to raise the tier.
