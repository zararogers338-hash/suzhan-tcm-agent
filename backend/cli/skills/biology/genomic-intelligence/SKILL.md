# Genomic Intelligence — DNA Sequence Models

Genomic Intelligence (GI) serves transformer DNA language models over six
sequence-analysis tasks on managed GPUs. Give it a **gene symbol**, a **genomic
region**, or a **DNA/FASTA sequence**; it returns structured predictions —
promoter regions, splice sites, enhancer activity, chromatin state, expression
(log TPM), and de-novo gene annotation. Nothing runs locally: no model weights,
no GPU, no heavy Python stack. It is a thin client over a hosted, versioned
inference API.

**Official docs:** [docs.genomicintelligence.ai](https://docs.genomicintelligence.ai) ·
REST contract at [api.genomicintelligence.ai/v1/openapi.json](https://api.genomicintelligence.ai/v1/openapi.json) ·
hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.genomicintelligence.ai/mcp`

## When to use this skill

Use GI when the user has DNA and wants a model prediction:

- **Find promoters** in a genomic region (`promoter`)
- **Predict splice** donor/acceptor sites (`splice`)
- **Score enhancer activity** — developmental & housekeeping (`enhancer`)
- **Annotate chromatin state** across hundreds of tracks (`chromatin`)
- **Predict expression** as log(TPM+1) from a sequence + cell-type context (`expression`)
- **Annotate genes/transcripts** de novo, no reference needed (`annotation`)
- **Find the genes in a region and predict each one's expression** (composite)

Not for local alignment, variant calling, or file I/O — use a local tool
(BioPython, bcftools) for those. GI is for **model inference from sequence**.

> Research and development use. Not for clinical or diagnostic decisions.

## Two ways to call GI

### Hosted MCP server (keyless; preferred on MCP hosts)

GI hosts an MCP server at `https://mcp.genomicintelligence.ai/mcp` (Streamable
HTTP). When your agent host supports MCP, prefer it: it works **keyless** against
a rate- and concurrency-limited public demo tier, and an optional `gi_` bearer
key raises those limits. It exposes acquisition tools that return a **sequence handle**
(`sequence_ref`) and `predict_*` tools that take that handle, so large sequences
stay out of the context. See [MCP workflow](#mcp-workflow-handle-based) below and
`references/mcp.md`.

### REST API (universal)

Plain HTTP with `requests` against `https://api.genomicintelligence.ai/v1`. The
REST path **requires** a `GI_API_KEY` (a `gi_` bearer). Use it on any host, in
scripts, or when you need the raw envelope. See [Core REST workflow](#core-rest-workflow).

## Access and authentication

1. The **hosted MCP demo is keyless** — try it with nothing set.
2. The **REST `/v1` API needs a key**, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
   Request one at [contact@genomicintelligence.ai](mailto:contact@genomicintelligence.ai).
3. **Never hardcode the key.** Read it from the `GI_API_KEY` environment variable
   (or a `.env` via `python-dotenv`). Never commit keys.

```bash
export GI_API_KEY="gi_yourkeyhere"     # optional for MCP; required for REST
export GI_BASE_URL="https://api.genomicintelligence.ai"   # override for staging
```

Keys are scoped to a partner tier with concurrency and per-minute caps. A `429`
means you hit a cap — back off and retry, or ask GI to raise your tier.

## The six tasks

Each task is **its own published operation** with its own request schema, its own
minimum length, and its own closed `options` object — `POST
/v1/tasks/promoter/predict`, `/v1/tasks/splice/predict`,
`/v1/tasks/enhancer/predict`, `/v1/tasks/chromatin/predict`,
`/v1/tasks/annotation/predict`, `/v1/tasks/expression/predict`. Each path is a
literal string, so nothing needs to be constructed, and there is no shared
`PredictRequest` schema. Body is `{sequence, sequence_name?, model?,
options?}`, returning a `{data, meta}` envelope. What differs per task:

| Task | Recommended mode | Accepted length | `context_window_bp` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `promoter` | sync | 300–500,000 bp | 2,000 bp | sliding-window promoter regions |
| `splice` | sync | 100–500,000 bp | 15,000 bp | donor/acceptor sites (long-context BigBird); strand-specific — feed transcript orientation |
| `enhancer` | sync | 50–500,000 bp | 249 bp | dev + housekeeping scores (DeepSTARR, *Drosophila*) |
| `chromatin` | sync | 200–500,000 bp | 1,000 bp | hundreds of tracks (DeepSEA) |
| `expression` | sync | **9,198–500,000 bp** | n/a (`trained_window_bp` 9,198) | log(TPM+1); needs `tss_index` unless exactly 9,198 bp, plus a cell-type `description` |
| `annotation` | async | 1,000–500,000 bp | n/a | de-novo transcripts; submit + poll; sync above 200,000 bp is `413 sync_too_large` |

`Recommended mode` is guidance, not a constraint — every task accepts both. Omit `Prefer` for a synchronous `200`; send `Prefer: respond-async` for a `202` plus `GET /v1/tasks/jobs/{job_id}`. The one enforced limit is per operation: where `/v1/openapi.json` publishes `x-sync-limit-bp` on a `POST`, a synchronous request above that length is `413 sync_too_large` — 200,000 bp on `annotation` and 50,000 bp on the composite workflow as of `info.version` 2026.09.10.1. Read the field rather than memorising the numbers; the other predict tasks carry no limit today.

**The minimum is admission control, not regime.** A request above the floor but
shorter than the selected model's `bio_spec.context_window_bp` is *accepted and
scored* — against a window padded out to the context window. Enhancer is the
sharp case: the floor is 50 bp but the context window is 249 bp, so 50–248 bp is
scored mostly on padding. Compare your length against
`context_window_bp` from `GET /v1/tasks/{task}/models` to know whether the model
saw real sequence. Longer-than-context input is fine — the scanner steps a
prediction window at a time and pads only the final partial window.

Under the floor and over the 500,000 bp cap are **both `422 validation_failed`**
at `loc ["body","sequence"]`; over-length is *not* a `413`. All lengths are
measured after whitespace is stripped, so a line-wrapped FASTA body can be pasted
verbatim (a `>` header line still fails the alphabet check).

`options` is typed and **closed** (`additionalProperties: false`) per task — an
unknown key is a hard `422 validation_failed` with `type: "extra_forbidden"`,
never ignored:

| Task | `options` keys |
|---|---|
| promoter | `threshold` (0–1, default 0.5) |
| splice | `threshold` (0–1, default 0.5), `site_types` (subset of `["donor","acceptor"]`, default both) |
| enhancer | *(none)* |
| chromatin | `threshold` (0–1, default 0.5) |
| annotation | `batch_size` (1–128, default 8), `shift_coordinates`, `reverse_complement` (default true) |
| expression | `description` — **required**, and the only key |

`Prefer: respond-async` is a declared header on **all six** predict operations
and on the composite, not just `annotation` — see [Async](#async-any-task-recommended-for-annotation).

**Omit `model` and the API uses the task's default** — that is the recommended
call. Default model IDs are intentionally **not** documented here: defaults
change and retired IDs fail hard, so never hardcode one. To pin a model, or to
pick a non-human one (Drosophila, yeast, and Arabidopsis models exist for several
tasks), discover IDs at call time with `GET /v1/tasks/{task}/models` (REST) or
`list_models` (MCP) — and **never invent one**. Full per-task output shapes are
in `references/tasks.md`.

`expression` is the strictest of the six: alone among them its schema requires
`options` as well as `sequence`. Three hard rules it enforces — every violation
is a `422`, nothing is padded or clamped, and there is no opt-out flag, header,
or query parameter:

- **It always scores exactly one 9,198 bp TSS-centred window** —
  `sequence[tss_index-4599 : tss_index+4599]`. The endpoint itself accepts
  **9,198–500,000 bp**; anything below 9,198 bp is rejected outright.
- **`tss_index` is required unless the sequence is exactly 9,198 bp.** It is the
  0-based TSS offset into the **whitespace-stripped** sequence, bounded by
  `4599 ≤ tss_index ≤ len(sequence) − 4599`. At exactly 9,198 bp it defaults to
  4,599, the only legal value there. So you may submit a whole locus (up to
  500 kb) and let the server cut the window — but the server does **not**
  discover the TSS for you (that is the composite workflow's job), and does
  **not** reverse-complement: submit gene-sense sequence.
- **`options.description`** — a cell-type / assay string (e.g. `"K562 cells"`) —
  is required, and is the **only** key `expression` accepts inside `options`.
  Unknown top-level body fields are rejected too.

> Note: the legal `tss_index` range is wide, so an offset that is merely
> *wrong* (counted over raw FASTA characters including newlines, or relative to
> a locus start rather than the submitted slice) does not error — it returns a
> confident `200` for the wrong window. Assert on
> `meta.task_specific_counts.scored_window` / `.tss_index` in the response.
> The length you submitted is `meta.sequence_length` (also echoed as
> `data.input.submitted_sequence_length`); the scored width is always 9,198,
> i.e. `scored_window[1] - scored_window[0]`. (`data.input.sequence_length`
> was removed at contract revision 13.)
>
> Both `tss_index` violations — "required unless exactly 9,198 bp" and the range
> check — come from a whole-model validator, so they surface at the body level
> rather than under `tss_index`. Match on `error.code == "validation_failed"`
> and use the message for display only. Any `loc` tuple quoted in this skill is
> illustrative of that shape, not part of the contract: it is not published in
> the schema and must not be branched on.

## Sequence acquisition

You rarely start from a raw 9,198 bp string. Acquire sequence first:

- **From a gene symbol** → MCP `fetch_ensembl_sequence(gene=...)`; **from
  coordinates** → `fetch_region(region=...)`. Both fetch public Ensembl reference
  sequence (no key). REST users can query Ensembl REST directly. (`find_genes` is
  the annotation task, not an acquisition tool.)
- **For `expression`** → use the TSS-centred fetch so the window is exactly
  9,198 bp. MCP: `fetch_gene_for_expression` (handles the centring). Otherwise
  fetch a wider locus and pass the TSS as `tss_index` so the server cuts the
  window — but compute that offset on the stripped nucleotide string, not on
  file characters.
- **From a local FASTA** → MCP `store_inline_sequence`, or read the file yourself
  for REST. (`load_local_fasta` exists only in local deployments, not on the
  hosted server.)
- **A demo sequence** → MCP `load_demo_sequence(name=...)` returns a ready handle
  for a keyless smoke test; `name` is required.

See `references/sequence-acquisition.md` for the exact Ensembl calls and the
expression-window math.

## Core REST workflow

Called synchronously — the default for every task — a prediction is one call:

```python
import os, requests

BASE = os.environ.get("GI_BASE_URL", "https://api.genomicintelligence.ai")
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['GI_API_KEY']}"}

def predict(task, sequence, sequence_name, model=None, options=None, tss_index=None):
    body = {"sequence": sequence, "sequence_name": sequence_name}
    if model:   body["model"] = model
    if options: body["options"] = options
    if tss_index is not None: body["tss_index"] = tss_index   # expression only
    # Each task is its own published operation, but the URL string is unchanged.
    r = requests.post(f"{BASE}/v1/tasks/{task}/predict", headers=HEADERS, json=body)
    # 422 validation_failed  — sequence under the task floor OR over 500,000 bp,
    #                          bad tss_index, missing options.description,
    #                          or ANY unknown body/options key (options is closed)
    # 401 no/bad key · 404 unknown task · 413 body over 16 MiB · 429 rate limit
    r.raise_for_status()
    return r.json()               # {"data": {...}, "meta": {...}}

# Promoter:
out = predict("promoter", seq, "TP53_region")
print(out["data"]["summary"])

# Expression — a pre-cut 9,198 bp TSS-centred window (tss_index defaults to 4,599):
out = predict("expression", tss_window_9198bp, "HBB",
              options={"description": "K562 cells"})
print(out["data"]["prediction"]["expression_log_tpm"])

# Expression — a whole locus; the server slices ±4,599 bp around the TSS you name.
# tss_index is 0-based into the whitespace-stripped sequence.
out = predict("expression", locus_seq, "HBB",
              options={"description": "K562 cells"}, tss_index=tss_offset_in_locus)
print(out["meta"]["task_specific_counts"]["scored_window"])   # confirm the window scored
```

### Async (any task; recommended for annotation)

`Prefer: respond-async` is a declared header parameter on all six predict
operations and on the composite. A `202` carries the same `{data, meta}` envelope
as a sync `200`, with `data = {job_id, status: "accepted", links}`; the job id is
also in the `Content-Location` and `X-Job-Id` response headers. Async is
JSON-only — combining it with a text `format` is rejected. `annotation` is the
task that needs it:

```python
import time

r = requests.post(f"{BASE}/v1/tasks/annotation/predict",
                  headers={**HEADERS, "Prefer": "respond-async"},
                  json={"sequence": seq, "sequence_name": "TP53"})
r.raise_for_status()              # 202 Accepted
job_id = r.json()["data"]["job_id"]

while True:
    j = requests.get(f"{BASE}/v1/tasks/jobs/{job_id}", headers=HEADERS)
    if j.status_code == 200:      # terminal: body is the final {data, meta}
        break
    j.raise_for_status()          # 202 = still running (2xx, won't raise)
    time.sleep(5)                 # ~20 s typical for ~20 kb
transcripts = j.json()["data"]["transcripts"]
```

## MCP workflow (handle-based)

On an MCP host, acquire a handle, then predict against it — sequences stay out of
the context:

```
# 1. Acquire a sequence handle (each returns a sequence_ref):
load_demo_sequence(name="promoter_tp53")  # keyless smoke test; name is required
fetch_ensembl_sequence(gene="TP53")       # gene symbol or Ensembl ID -> handle
fetch_region(region="chr11:5,225,000-5,235,000")   # coordinates -> handle
fetch_gene_for_expression(gene="HBB")     # TSS-centred 9,198 bp handle for expression

# 2. Predict against the handle:
predict_promoter(sequence_ref=<ref>)
predict_expression(sequence_ref=<ref>, description="K562 cells")
predict_splice(sequence_ref=<ref>)        # + predict_enhancer / predict_chromatin

# 3. Annotation on MCP is `find_genes` (there is no predict_annotation).
#    It takes a handle, not a region, and runs async internally:
find_genes(sequence_ref=<ref>)            # wait=True (default) returns the result
find_genes(sequence_ref=<ref>, wait=False)  # -> job_id; poll get_job(job_id)

# Discover models with list_models(task); reference context lives in the
# gi://models, gi://docs/tasks, and gi://account MCP resources.
```

## Composite: find genes, then predict expression

To answer "what genes are in this region and how are they expressed?", use the
composite:

- **MCP:** `find_genes_and_predict_expression(sequence_ref=..., description=...)`
  — takes a **handle, not a region** (acquire one with `fetch_region` first);
  `description` is required. Finds genes in the sequence and returns an
  expression prediction for each.
- **REST:** one call — `POST /v1/workflows/find-genes-and-predict-expression`,
  body `{sequence, options}` with `sequence` 1,000–500,000 bp and
  `options.description` (cell type / assay) required; a missing or empty
  description is a `422 validation_failed`. It annotates, centres a 9,198 bp
  window on each discovered gene's TSS (padding with `N` up to half the window
  rather than dropping an edge gene), and returns a prediction per gene.
  `meta.task_specific_counts` = `{genes_found, genes_predicted, genes_skipped}`
  with `genes_predicted + genes_skipped == genes_found`; per-gene causes in
  `data.expression_predictions[].skip_reason`. Above **50,000 bp** (its `x-sync-limit-bp`) it forces
  async: a synchronous request over that size is `413 sync_too_large` with
  `error.details = {sequence_length, threshold}` — retry the same body with
  `Prefer: respond-async`.

## Errors

| Code | `error.code` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `bad_request` | Malformed request | Check the body shape |
| 401 / 403 | `unauthorized` / `forbidden` | Missing/invalid key (REST) | Set `GI_API_KEY`; or use the keyless MCP demo |
| 404 | `not_found` | **Unknown task** (`/v1/tasks/bogus/predict`) or unknown job | Check the task name — an unrecognised task is a 404, not a 422 |
| 413 | `payload_too_large` | Raw request body over **16 MiB** | Split the input — this is the body cap, not the sequence cap |
| 413 | `sync_too_large` | Synchronous request above the operation's `x-sync-limit-bp` (200,000 bp on `annotation`, 50,000 bp on the composite) | Retry with `Prefer: respond-async` |
| 415 | `unsupported_format` | Unsupported `format` query value | Use a format the task supports; there is no silent fallback to JSON |
| 422 | `validation_failed` | The most common failure: sequence **under the task floor or over 500,000 bp**, expression below 9,198 bp, a missing/out-of-range `tss_index`, a missing `options.description`, or **any unknown body or `options` key** | Read the message; fix the body |
| 429 | `rate_limited` / `too_many_requests` | Rate / concurrency cap | Back off (honour `Retry-After`); ask GI to raise your tier |
| 5xx | `internal_error` / `service_unavailable` / `model_loading` / `timeout` | Server error | Retry; if persistent, contact support |

`error.code` is a closed 21-value enum (`bad_request`, `unauthorized`,
`forbidden`, `not_found`, `conflict`, `job_expired`, `payload_too_large`,
`sync_too_large`, `unsupported_format`, `validation_failed`,
`too_many_requests`, `rate_limited`, `internal_error`, `timeout`,
`insufficient_memory`, `model_not_found`, `task_not_supported_by_model`,
`model_loading`, `service_unavailable`, `http_error`, `unknown`); treat an
unlisted value as a generic failure, not a parse error.

**Branch on `code`, never on `details` or `loc`.** `details` is keyed on the
sibling `code`; for `validation_failed` it is the `{errors: [{loc, msg, type}, …]}`
object the schema declares. Treat it as display-only — `code` is the stable
discriminator.

For correlation, `error.request_id` and the `X-Request-Id` **header** are both
set on every response, and success envelopes carry `meta.request_id`. Reading
the header first remains a safe default.
Every response carries `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`,
`RateLimit-Reset`, `RateLimit-Policy`; a `429` adds `Retry-After`.

> and `info.version` in `/v1/openapi.json` reports what a given deployment
> serves: if it is ahead of the version above, re-check the numbers in this file
> against that document, which is the arbiter if the two disagree.
