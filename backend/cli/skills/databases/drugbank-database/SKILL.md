# DrugBank Database

## Overview

DrugBank contains drug and drug-target information. The bundled helper reads a licensed local XML export; it does not include the dataset or download it automatically. Available records depend on the supplied export and its version.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Data Access and Authentication

Access a DrugBank export that the user is licensed to use. The skill provides guidance on:

- Supplying an explicit local XML path or a pre-loaded XML root
- Keeping licensed data out of repositories and shared artifacts
- Recording the supplied database version
- Opening and parsing XML data efficiently
- Working with cached data to optimize performance

**When to use**: Setting up local DrugBank analysis or diagnosing a missing export.

**Reference**: See `references/data-access.md` for loading an explicitly provided licensed export, the current availability of DrugBank downloads, the separate hosted API, and troubleshooting.

### 2. Drug Information Queries

Extract comprehensive drug information from the database including identifiers, chemical properties, pharmacology, clinical data, and cross-references to external databases.

**Query capabilities**:
- Search by DrugBank ID, name, CAS number, or keywords
- Extract basic drug information (name, type, description, indication)
- Retrieve chemical properties (SMILES, InChI, molecular formula)
- Get pharmacology data (mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, ADME)
- Access external identifiers (PubChem, ChEMBL, UniProt, KEGG)
- Build searchable drug datasets and export to DataFrames
- Filter drugs by type (small molecule, biotech, nutraceutical)

**When to use**: Retrieving specific drug information, building drug databases, pharmacology research, literature review, drug profiling.

**Reference**: See `references/drug-queries.md` for XML navigation, query functions, data extraction methods, and performance optimization.

### 3. Drug-Drug Interactions Analysis

Analyze drug-drug interactions (DDIs) including mechanism, clinical significance, and interaction networks for pharmacovigilance and clinical decision support.

**Analysis capabilities**:
- Extract all interactions for specific drugs
- Build bidirectional interaction networks
- Classify interactions by severity and mechanism
- Check interactions between drug pairs
- Identify drugs with most interactions
- Analyze polypharmacy regimens for safety
- Create interaction matrices and network graphs
- Perform community detection in interaction networks
- Calculate interaction risk scores

**When to use**: Polypharmacy safety analysis, clinical decision support, drug interaction prediction, pharmacovigilance research, identifying contraindications.

**Reference**: See `references/interactions.md` for interaction extraction, classification methods, network analysis, and clinical applications.

### 4. Drug Targets and Pathways

Access detailed information about drug-protein interactions including targets, enzymes, transporters, carriers, and biological pathways.

**Target analysis capabilities**:
- Extract drug targets with actions (inhibitor, agonist, antagonist)
- Identify metabolic enzymes (CYP450, Phase II enzymes)
- Analyze transporters (uptake, efflux) for ADME studies
- Map drugs to biological pathways (SMPDB)
- Find drugs targeting specific proteins
- Identify drugs with shared targets for repurposing
- Analyze polypharmacology and off-target effects
- Extract Gene Ontology (GO) terms for targets
- Cross-reference with UniProt for protein data

**When to use**: Mechanism of action studies, drug repurposing research, target identification, pathway analysis, predicting off-target effects, understanding drug metabolism.

**Reference**: See `references/targets-pathways.md` for target extraction, pathway analysis, repurposing strategies, CYP450 profiling, and transporter analysis.

### 5. Chemical Properties and Similarity

Perform structure-based analysis including molecular similarity searches, property calculations, substructure searches, and ADMET predictions.

**Chemical analysis capabilities**:
- Extract chemical structures (SMILES, InChI, molecular formula)
- Calculate physicochemical properties (MW, logP, PSA, H-bonds)
- Apply Lipinski's Rule of Five and Veber's rules
- Calculate Tanimoto similarity between molecules
- Generate molecular fingerprints (Morgan, MACCS, topological)
- Perform substructure searches with SMARTS patterns
- Find structurally similar drugs for repurposing
- Create similarity matrices for drug clustering
- Predict oral absorption and BBB permeability
- Analyze chemical space with PCA and clustering
- Export chemical property databases

**When to use**: Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, drug similarity searches, QSAR modeling, drug-likeness assessment, ADMET prediction, chemical space exploration.

**Reference**: See `references/chemical-analysis.md` for structure extraction, similarity calculations, fingerprint generation, ADMET predictions, and chemical space analysis.

## Typical Workflows

### Drug Discovery Workflow
1. Use `data-access.md` to load an explicitly provided licensed export
2. Use `drug-queries.md` to build searchable drug database
3. Use `chemical-analysis.md` to find similar compounds
4. Use `targets-pathways.md` to identify shared targets
5. Use `interactions.md` to check safety of candidate combinations

### Polypharmacy Safety Analysis
1. Use `drug-queries.md` to look up patient medications
2. Use `interactions.md` to check all pairwise interactions
3. Use `interactions.md` to classify interaction severity
4. Use `interactions.md` to calculate overall risk score
5. Use `targets-pathways.md` to understand interaction mechanisms

### Drug Repurposing Research
1. Use `targets-pathways.md` to find drugs with shared targets
2. Use `chemical-analysis.md` to find structurally similar drugs
3. Use `drug-queries.md` to extract indication and pharmacology data
4. Use `interactions.md` to assess potential combination therapies

### Pharmacology Study
1. Use `drug-queries.md` to extract drug of interest
2. Use `targets-pathways.md` to identify all protein interactions
3. Use `targets-pathways.md` to map to biological pathways
4. Use `chemical-analysis.md` to predict ADMET properties
5. Use `interactions.md` to identify potential contraindications

## Installation Requirements

### Python Packages
```bash
# The local XML helper uses only the Python standard library.
# Install only the packages needed for the selected analysis:
uv pip install lxml                 # XML parsing optimization
uv pip install pandas               # Data manipulation
uv pip install rdkit                # Chemical informatics (for similarity)
uv pip install networkx             # Network analysis (for interactions)
uv pip install scikit-learn         # ML/clustering (for chemical space)
```

### Account Setup
Obtain an XML export through the user's authorized DrugBank access; the helper only
loads an explicitly provided licensed export. An account or installed downloader does
not prove download entitlement, and `references/data-access.md` records the current
status of DrugBank downloads. Do not fetch a different or unlicensed copy as a fallback.

From the skill directory:

```python
from scripts.drugbank_helper import DrugBankHelper

db = DrugBankHelper(xml_path="/path/to/licensed/drugbank.xml")
print(db.get_drug_info("DB00001"))
```

Alternatively set `DRUGBANK_XML_PATH` and use `DrugBankHelper()`. A previously
parsed XML root is still accepted with `DrugBankHelper(root=root)`.

## Data Version and Reproducibility

Record the version and checksum of the supplied XML export in analysis metadata.
Do not silently substitute an older export when the requested version is unavailable.

## Best Practices

1. **Credentials**: Use environment variables or config files, never hardcode
2. **Versioning**: Specify exact database version for reproducibility
3. **Caching**: Cache parsed data to avoid re-parsing the export
4. **Namespaces**: Handle XML namespaces properly when parsing
5. **Validation**: Validate chemical structures with RDKit before use
6. **Cross-referencing**: Use external identifiers (UniProt, PubChem) for integration
7. **Clinical Context**: Always consider clinical context when interpreting interaction data
8. **License Compliance**: Ensure proper licensing for your use case

## Reference Documentation

All detailed implementation guidance is organized in modular reference files:

- **references/data-access.md**: Loading a licensed export, download availability, parsing, hosted API, caching
- **references/drug-queries.md**: XML navigation, query methods, data extraction, indexing
- **references/interactions.md**: DDI extraction, classification, network analysis, safety scoring
- **references/targets-pathways.md**: Target/enzyme/transporter extraction, pathway mapping, repurposing
- **references/chemical-analysis.md**: Structure extraction, similarity, fingerprints, ADMET prediction

Load these references as needed based on your specific analysis requirements.
